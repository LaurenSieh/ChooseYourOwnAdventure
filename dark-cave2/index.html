    <div class="prompt">As you walk farther through the cave into the darkest, a disgusting smell starts to appear. Next think you know you trip over something. You try to feel with around you hands what you tripped over. It find a stone-like bolder. As you continue to feel around it with your hands, you realize what you are touching is a skull. You quickly throw it away from you, completely freaked out. Behind you, you hear a menacing growl. Next thing you know, you are attacked by something. You try and hit it with the sturdy log that you brought with you, but it easly snaps in half once it hits the creature. It is just to strong to fight and you have no idea how to escape the dark cave.</div>
