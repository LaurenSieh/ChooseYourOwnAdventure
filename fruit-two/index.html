    <div class="prompt">After leaving the hut with your pockets full of the items you found, you approach where you first saw fruit in the tree tops. You look up and think to yourself, "They sure are high up there. It's proably 20 to 30 feet of the ground." You take of your shirt and throw it around the tree to try and climb it. You are able to make it almost to the top. You see the fruit hanging down just mere inches away. You'll have to go up a little farther. As you reach eye level with the fruit, with the knife that you found you cut down some fruit. You watch as it falls to the ground. You just secured some food for the night. You continue to hit a couple more fruits down from the tree. Once you are satisfied, you slowly but surely make your way down the tree. As you reach the bottom, in the distance you hear a low mutter. You realize that's the sound of a plane! You need to head back to shore and get the plane to notice you. This is your chance of making it off the island!</div>
