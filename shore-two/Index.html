You burst through the treeline, almost triping over the scattered plane parts of the beach. You see the plane directly in front of you in the sky about 3 from the island. You start to scream and the top of your lungs and wave your arms like crazy. However, the plane doesn't seem to see you. You then remember the flare that you found it the hut. You take the flare out and quickly light it. You start waving it around and screaming. The plane seems to be turning towards you. It saw you! The plane is coming to resue you from the island.</div>
