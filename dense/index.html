    <div class="prompt">You decided that the denser path is worth exploring. It  doesn't hurt to look just once right? As you make you way through low hanging branches and overgrown brush, you come across a lush meadow of sorts. What surprizes you the most though, it that within the meadow is an abondoned hut. You barley noticed it at first due to vines taking over the entire stucture. You think to yourself that this might be the perfect place for a shelter. But why is it abandoned? Is there something in there that you shouldn't see.</div>
