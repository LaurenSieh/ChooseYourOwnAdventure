    <div class="prompt">As you get closer to the hut, you look for a way inside. Underneath all the vines and greener is a small opening. You'll have to dig your way through. As you make your way through the small opening, you finally get inside. It opens up to a single room. Inside the room is a chest, what looks like to be a cot and some wood. The first thing you do is check out the chest. It doesn't seem to be lock but rather the lock is broken. You wonder why the lock is broken but quickly push that thought aside due to your curiousity wanting to know what's in the chest. You open the chest. Inside there is only three items, a flare, flint and a knife. You decide that it's best to carry all three items with you at all times. Now that you found shelter and water, it would be wise to go back to the fruit you saw earlier and try getting them down form the tree tops. </div>
