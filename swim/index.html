    <div class="prompt">The only way to get the crate is to swim out and retrieve it. With a burst of engery and determination, you take off your already wet clothes because there's not use of getting them any wetter. You run into the water and start to make your way to the crate. You start to realize the crate is much farther out than you orginally thought. You're now losing the new found engery that you just had from fighting against the current. You are getting tired very quickly and it's now apparent that retrieving the crate is a lost cause. You decide it's better to try and make it back to shore. However, you are so far out that the current is now pulling you away from the island. You are now expereincing trouble staying above water and swimming back in general. Soon a big wave comes and takes you under.</div>
