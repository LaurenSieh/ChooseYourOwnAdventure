<body>
    <div class="prompt">You decide to play it safe and go down the clearer pathway. The path is fairly open with the sun shining through the trees. It's almost gives you a sense of peace despite your current situation. Coming from farther down the path, you hear the distance running of water. You get excited at the sound and start down the path quicker to the source. At the end of the path it opens up to the most beautiful place that you had ever seen. Before you eyes is a waterfall ludging down to a small lake. Fresh Water! You have stubble upon your water source that will help you survive on this island. Now you only need to find shelter and figure out how to get those fruits from the treetops. Maybe you should explore the other pathway to see what is down there.</div>
