    <div class="prompt">As you walk along the beach, you gather some wood you'll know you need for a fire later. You start to make out what is floating in the water. It's a crate! It's from your plane. You know that inside of it is an emergency kit that is to help you survive if you every got stranded. However, it is quite a ways off of the shore.</div>
