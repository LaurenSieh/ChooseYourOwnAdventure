    <div class="prompt">You approach the body and in the sand. You quickly realize that the body is one of the passengers that was on your plane and that they are no longer alive. There is something on top of the body. It looks like a wolf but only 10 times bigger. The wolf-like creature is feasting on the body. You slowly back up because you know that you are not going to be able to fight it out if it comes toward you. The beast suddenly stops and looks in your direction. You qickly turn and run the other way, but it's no use. The beast catches up with you quickly and attacks you. You scream in pain and try to fight it off. It's no use. the beast is to strong. </div>
