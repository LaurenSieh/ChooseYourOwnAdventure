    <div class="prompt">As you make your way through the forest, you see fruits hung high up in the trees. You'll have to come back later once you figure out how to reach them. You decide to go deeper into the forest to search for water and maybe you'll fins some shelter on the way. You come across a natural pathway with a fork in the middle. On on side, the pathway is clear and you can clearly see where you are going. On the other side, the forest become denser and harder to see where you are going. Which pathway do you take?</div>

        <a href="../clear">Down the clear pathway</a>
        <a href="../dense">Down the dense pathway</a>
